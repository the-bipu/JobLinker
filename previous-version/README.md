# JobLinker App

JobLinker is a mobile application that fetches and provides job data from a designated API. This app is designed to help users easily find and apply for available job opportunities.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the JobLinker app on your local development environment, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm must be installed on your machine. You can download them [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Expo CLI must be installed. You can install it globally using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JobLinker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd JobLinker
```

3. Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App
Start the Expo development server:

```bash
expo start
```

The Expo DevTools will open in your default web browser. You can use these tools to run the app on an emulator or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

### Configuration

Before running the app, make sure to configure the API endpoint in the `config.js` file:

```bash
export const API_URL = 'https://example.com/api';
```

Replace `https://example.com/api` with the actual URL of the job data API.
